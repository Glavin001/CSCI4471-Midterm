# Curves

When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$$ and they are
$$x = {-c \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$


$$\begin{bmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{bmatrix}$$


for question 2 I hand wrote it but used software for inverse

when I am at that question, ill ask you what that means
using software for inverse
isn't it variables ?
not an actual matrix with #s

inverse matrix
like in class
we just never computed
because its a pain

for the "t"s ?
or u in this cas ?
e

we had [t^2 t 1][a b c]
where a b c is vertical
abc is replaced with the inverse matrix and a column matrix of x1, x2, x3
or p1, p2, p1prime in this case

ok I think I follow.. so
f(u) = [t^2, t, 1]^T * M * [P1, P2, P1']
What's M represent? is that the inverse matrix ?

M is the inverse matrix you get from the system of equations
you get a matrix from the system of equations
then M is the inverse of that
