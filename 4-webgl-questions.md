# WebGL Video Questions

1) What is meant by `in`, `out`, `uniform` variable “types” in OpenGL programming?

2) In the rotating cube example, what data/parameters is passed from the main display routine (which is running in the CPU) to the GPU? How would this scale if the model is an object with millions of vertices instead of just a cube?


3) When doing lighting/illumination computations, what do they say is the key trade-off between using the vertex shader versus using the fragment shader?
